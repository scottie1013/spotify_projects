## Music Recommendation using ML

As I recently finished several of the machine learning courses on DataCamp, I was eager to put my newfound knowledge to the test by building a Spotify recommendation algorithm. As an avid user of the Spotify app, I was particularly interested in using machine learning to improve my own music listening experience.

## Planning:

As I began to plan the construction of my recommendation system, I knew that careful planning and consideration of various factors would be crucial to its success. One of the first things I did was to carefully select the features that I would include in my model. I knew that including too many features could increase the computational cost of the machine learning process, so I made sure to only include those that were essential in determining the likeability of a song.

I decided to use my personal playlists as the training dataset and Spotify's official playlists as the testing dataset. My goal was to use my personal playlists to "train" the model to understand my preferences and then use the Spotify official playlists to see if the model could accurately predict whether I would like a song from those playlists. This allowed me to test the effectiveness of my recommendation system in a real-world setting.
I also spent a lot of time researching and evaluating different machine learning algorithms to determine which one would be the best fit for my data. This required me to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm and how they might perform on my specific dataset. 

## Implementing: 
There are times when I faced challenges throughout the implementing process. One of the first challenges I faced was getting used to the Spotify API. While I had a basic understanding of how APIs worked, actually implementing one in my project was a new experience. It took some time and trial and error to get the API correctly integrated into my code.

Next, As I worked on my recommendation system, Although I have taken courses on data camp, I realized my understanding of the Machine Learning algorithms still remain on the surface level. I therefore had to familiarize myself with the math behind each algorithm that I planned to use. This required a lot of self-study and referencing of online resources to fully grasp the concepts. It was a time-consuming process, but I found it to be incredibly rewarding as I began to understand the inner workings of these algorithms and how they could be applied to real-world problems.

Despite my best efforts, there were times when my code simply did not work as intended. I had to rely on my analytical and problem-solving skills to troubleshoot and fix any issues that arose. This often involved debugging my code, testing various hypotheses, and seeking the help of others when necessary. Building a recommendation algorithm is a complex task, and I found that referencing the work of others was essential in helping me understand the various approaches that have been taken to solve this problem. 

## User Behavior Analysis: 

In addition to researching the work of others and implementing various machine learning algorithms, I also took the time to study my own streaming data in an effort to better understand my own listening habits and preferences. This involved using various visualization tools to help me see patterns and trends in my data.

For example, I used a line chart to track the number of songs I listened to on a daily basis over a period of time. This helped me see how my listening habits changed over time and allowed me to identify any trends or patterns that emerged. I also used bar charts and scatter plots to compare different songs and artists based on various metrics, such as the number of streams or the average duration of a song.
Through this process, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of my own listening behavior and identify some of my preferred genres and artists. I believe this knowledge could be incorporated into my recommendation algorithm, allowing it to make more personalized and accurate recommendations for me.

Overall, building a Spotify recommendation algorithm was a challenging but rewarding experience. It allowed me to apply the machine learning concepts that I learned in my courses to a real-world problem, and it required me to develop and hone my analytical and problem-solving skills. While there were certainly difficulties along the way, the end result was a recommendation system that I am proud of and that has improved my music listening experience on Spotify.
